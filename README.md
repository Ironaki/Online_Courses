# Data Structure

This is my self study of Berkeley CS61B, Data Structure (Spring 17 Version). http://datastructur.es/sp17/index.html This is also my first time to learn git.

## Progress

Everything is finished except:
1. Front end of project2 Database, which is tedious. It can be done with regex and multiple if expressions.
1. Homework2 Percolation, which I did in Princeton Algorithms class.

## Attention

Please do not use my code if you are enrolled in this course. You should do your own work, and there is no guarantee of correctness of my code.
